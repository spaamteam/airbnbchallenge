# scikit-learn Beginner Tutorials

This is my abridged, to-the-point, implementation of the [official scikit-learn tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html). If you are familiar with both Python and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), this may be a quicker way to get through the material. There are a few minor changes to the original material (I believe), but it follows the original quite faithfully.

As such, all credit goes to the creator(s) of the original material. I make no claim of ownership or innovation; my role was simply peeling away what I felt to be unnecessary information for those beginners to sckit-learn who are __not__, otherwise, beginners to machine learning.

Notebooks are numbered, and follow the tutorials in order.
