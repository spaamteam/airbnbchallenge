## Installation:

1. Download Python 3.5 (Anaconda includes basic utility packages so one doesn't have to worry about installing them individually) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2. Download Git's latest version for your OS from https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Run git-bash (Git Shell) and navigate to your source directory (e.g. `cd ~/Desktop/airbnb`)
4. Time to configure Git, by running `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and then `git config --global user.email username@email.com` (make sure your email and name is same as used on GitHub while creating your account)
5. For great speed at development, install the powerful **Atom** by GitHub from https://atom.io
6. Time to configure atom to work with Git by running `git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`
7. Run `git clone https://github.com/spaamteam/airbnbchallenge.git airbnb` to create a folder on your computer with initial source code.
8. Navigate to this newly created directory *airbnb* `cd airbnb`
9. Run test script to check if you installed properly `python3 test_install.py` , which should run test cases.
10. Test python by running `python3 your_script.py` from Terminal/Command-Prompt.
11. To edit your python script, `atom your_script.py` and atom props up, ready for you to make changes and save.

If any problems still remain, feel free to Google them up or let me know if there's any additional step that you had to do & I should have included in this guide.

## Working with Git

*Required every time one wants to publish an update*
- `git status` : Informs you about which files are modified/added
- `git add filename.py` : Adds the file to version tracking
- `git commit -m "Informative Message"` : Message to inform others of the update [usually less than 50 characters]
- `git pull` : Pulls new changes from the central repository @ GitHub
- `git push` : Publishes changes to central repo for others to observe and work on
